## David Caplan
With close to 40 years’ experience in economic statistics and public sector data analysis, David has spent his career working at the intersection of economic measurement, policy insight, and practical implementation.

He began his career in the Government Statistical Service (GSS), where he specialised in national accounting and held several senior roles in the development and compilation of the UK National Accounts. During this time, he also acted as a consultant to Eurostat, supporting reviews of national accounts practices in other European countries — work that deepened his understanding of international standards and cross-country comparability.

Following his time in government, he took on leadership roles outside the civil service, including as Director of Research and Analysis at the Audit Commission, Head of Research and Analytics at CIPFA, and as co-founder of the economic consultancy Belmana, where he worked extensively with central and local government and the third sector.

Throughout his career, he has maintained a strong commitment to statistical standards and governance. He is a Chartered Statistician and an active member of the Royal Statistical Society. Currently, he serves on the National Statistician’s Advisory Committee on standards for economic statistics.

Now a Research Associate at the Economic Statistics Centre of Excellence (ESCoE), he is working on a project exploring methods for improving coherence and balance in the national accounts framework — an area where his technical expertise and real-world experience make him uniquely qualified.

David's experience covers multiple aspects of the public sector including councils, police and fire services housing. He has also worked witht he third sector and been a charity trustee and treasurer. 

Away from official statistics, David is currently exploring different use cases for generative AI — including as a personal trainer, cookery teacher, and thinking partner for curiosity-driven conversations.
